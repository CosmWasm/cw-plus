# CW3 Fixed Multisig

This is a simple implementation of the [cw3 spec](../../packages/cw3/README.md).
It is a multisig with a fixed set of addresses created upon instantiation.
Each address may have the same weight (K of N), or some may have extra voting
power. This works much like the native Cosmos SDK multisig, except that rather
than aggregating the signatures off chain and submitting the final result,
we aggregate the approvals on-chain.

This is usable as is, and probably the most secure implementation of cw3
(as it is the simplest), but we will be adding more complex cases, such
as updating the multisig set, different voting rules for the same group
with different permissions, and even allow token-weighted voting. All through
the same client interface.

## Instantiation

To create the multisig, you must pass in a set of `HumanAddr` with a weight
for each one, as well as a required weight to pass a proposal. To create
a 2 of 3 multisig, pass 3 voters with weight 1 and a `required_weight` of 2.

Note that 0 *is an allowed weight*. This doesn't give any voting rights, but
it does allow that key to submit proposals that can later be approved by the
voters. Any address not in the voter set cannot submit a proposal.

## Execution Process

First, a registered voter must submit a proposal. This also includes the
first "Yes" vote on the proposal by the proposer. The proposer can set
an expiration time for the voting process, or it defaults to the limit
provided when creating the contract (so proposals can be closed after several
days).

Before the proposal has expired, any voter with non-zero weight can add their
vote. Only "Yes" votes are tallied. If enough "Yes" votes were submitted before
the proposal expiration date, the status is set to "Passed".

Once a proposal is "Passed", anyone may submit an "Execute" message. This will
trigger the proposal to send all stored messages from the proposal and update
it's state to "Executed", so it cannot run again. (Note if the execution fails
for any reason - out of gas, insufficient funds, etc - the state update will
be reverted, and it will remain "Passed", so you can try again).

Once a proposal has expired without passing, anyone can submit a "Close"
message to mark it closed. This has no effect beyond cleaning up the UI/database.

## Running this contract

You will need Rust 1.44.1+ with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.

You can run unit tests on this via: 

`cargo test`

Once you are happy with the content, you can compile it to wasm via:

```
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
cp ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw3_fixed_multisig.wasm .
ls -l cw3_fixed_multisig.wasm
sha256sum cw3_fixed_multisig.wasm
```

Or for a production-ready (optimized) build, run a build command in the
repository root: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus#compiling.
