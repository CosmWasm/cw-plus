# CW1 Spec: Proxy Contracts

CW1 is a specification for proxy contracts based on CosmWasm.
It is a very simple, but flexible interface designed for the case
where one contract is meant to hold assets (or rights) on behalf of
other contracts.

The simplest example is a contract that will accept messages from
the creator and resend them from its address. Simply by making this
transferable, you can then begin to transfer non-transferable assets
(eg. staked tokens, voting power, etc).

You can imagine more complex examples, such as a "1 of N" multisig,
or conditional approval, where "sub-accounts" have the right to spend
a limited amount of funds from this account, with a "admin account"
retaining full control.

The common denominator is that they allow you to immediately
execute arbitrary `CosmosMsg` in the same transaction.

### Messages

`Execute{msgs}` - This accepts `Vec<CosmosMsg>` and checks permissions
before re-dispatching all those messages from the contract address.

### Queries

`CanExecute{sender, msg}` - This accepts one `CosmosMsg` and checks permissions,
returning true or false based on the permissions. If `CanExecute` returns true
then a call to `Execute` from that sender, with the same message, 
before any further state changes, should also succeed. This can be used 
to dynamically provide some client info on a generic cw1 contract without 
knowing the extension details. (eg. detect if they can send coins or stake)
