# CW-Storage-Plus: Enhanced/experimental storage engines for CosmWasm

The ideas in here are based on the `cosmwasm-storage` crate. However,
after much usage, we decided a complete rewrite could allow us to add
more powerful and easy to use interfaces. Here are those interfaces.

**Status: beta**

This has been heavily used in many production-quality contracts and
heavily refined. There is one planned API break (dealing with
auto-deserializing keys in range queries), but the code has demonstrated
itself to be stable and powerful. Please feel free to use in your contracts.

## Usage Overview

We introduce two main classes to provide a productive abstraction
on top of `cosmwasm_std::Storage`. They are `Item`, which is
a typed wrapper around one database key, providing some helper functions
for interacting with it without dealing with raw bytes. And `Map`,
which allows you to store multiple unique typed objects under a prefix,
indexed by a simple (`&[u8]`) or compound (eg. `(&[u8], &[u8])`) primary key.

These correspond to the concepts represented in `cosmwasm_storage` by
`Singleton` and `Bucket`, but with a re-designed API and implementation
to require less typing for developers and less gas usage in the contracts.

## Item

The usage of an [`Item`](./src/item.rs) is pretty straight-forward.
You must simply provide the proper type, as well as a database key not
used by any other item. Then it will provide you with a nice interface
to interact with such data.

If you are coming from using `Singleton`, the biggest change is that
we no longer store `Storage` inside, meaning we don't need read and write
variants of the object, just one type. Furthermore, we use `const fn`
to create the `Item`, allowing it to be defined as a global compile-time
constant rather than a function that must be constructed each time,
which saves gas as well as typing.

Example Usage:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Config {
    pub owner: String,
    pub max_tokens: i32,
}

// note const constructor rather than 2 functions with Singleton
const CONFIG: Item<Config> = Item::new("config");

fn demo() -> StdResult<()> {
    let mut store = MockStorage::new();

    // may_load returns Option<T>, so None if data is missing
    // load returns T and Err(StdError::NotFound{}) if data is missing
    let empty = CONFIG.may_load(&store)?;
    assert_eq!(None, empty);
    let cfg = Config {
        owner: "admin".to_string(),
        max_tokens: 1234,
    };
    CONFIG.save(&mut store, &cfg)?;
    let loaded = CONFIG.load(&store)?;
    assert_eq!(cfg, loaded);

    // update an item with a closure (includes read and write)
    // returns the newly saved value
    let output = CONFIG.update(&mut store, |mut c| -> StdResult<_> {
        c.max_tokens *= 2;
        Ok(c)
    })?;
    assert_eq!(2468, output.max_tokens);

    // you can error in an update and nothing is saved
    let failed = CONFIG.update(&mut store, |_| -> StdResult<_> {
        Err(StdError::generic_err("failure mode"))
    });
    assert!(failed.is_err());

    // loading data will show the first update was saved
    let loaded = CONFIG.load(&store)?;
    let expected = Config {
        owner: "admin".to_string(),
        max_tokens: 2468,
    };
    assert_eq!(expected, loaded);

    // we can remove data as well
    CONFIG.remove(&mut store);
    let empty = CONFIG.may_load(&store)?;
    assert_eq!(None, empty);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Map

The usage of an [`Map`](./src/item.rs) is a little more complex, but
is still pretty straight-forward. You can imagine it as a storage-backed
`BTreeMap`, allowing key-value lookups with typed values. In addition,
we support not only simple binary keys (`&[u8]`), but tuples, which are
combined. This allows us to store allowances as composite keys
eg. `(owner, spender)` to look up the balance.

Beyond direct lookups, we have a super power not found in Ethereum -
iteration. That's right, you can list all items in a `Map`, or only
part of them. We can efficiently allow pagination over these items as
well, starting at the point the last query ended, with low gas costs.
This requires the `iterator` feature to be enabled in `cw-storage-plus`
(which automatically enables it in `cosmwasm-std` as well, and which is
enabled by default).

If you are coming from using `Bucket`, the biggest change is that
we no longer store `Storage` inside, meaning we don't need read and write
variants of the object, just one type. Furthermore, we use `const fn`
to create the `Bucket`, allowing it to be defined as a global compile-time
constant rather than a function that must be constructed each time,
which saves gas as well as typing. In addition, the composite indexes
(tuples) is more ergonomic and expressive of intention, and the range
interface has been improved.

Here is an example with normal (simple) keys:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
struct Data {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}

const PEOPLE: Map<&str, Data> = Map::new("people");

fn demo() -> StdResult<()> {
    let mut store = MockStorage::new();
    let data = Data {
        name: "John".to_string(),
        age: 32,
    };

    // load and save with extra key argument
    let empty = PEOPLE.may_load(&store, "john")?;
    assert_eq!(None, empty);
    PEOPLE.save(&mut store, "john", &data)?;
    let loaded = PEOPLE.load(&store, "john")?;
    assert_eq!(data, loaded);

    // nothing on another key
    let missing = PEOPLE.may_load(&store, "jack")?;
    assert_eq!(None, missing);

    // update function for new or existing keys
    let birthday = |d: Option<Data>| -> StdResult<Data> {
        match d {
            Some(one) => Ok(Data {
                name: one.name,
                age: one.age + 1,
            }),
            None => Ok(Data {
                name: "Newborn".to_string(),
                age: 0,
            }),
        }
    };

    let old_john = PEOPLE.update(&mut store, "john", birthday)?;
    assert_eq!(33, old_john.age);
    assert_eq!("John", old_john.name.as_str());

    let new_jack = PEOPLE.update(&mut store, "jack", birthday)?;
    assert_eq!(0, new_jack.age);
    assert_eq!("Newborn", new_jack.name.as_str());

    // update also changes the store
    assert_eq!(old_john, PEOPLE.load(&store, "john")?);
    assert_eq!(new_jack, PEOPLE.load(&store, "jack")?);

    // removing leaves us empty
    PEOPLE.remove(&mut store, "john");
    let empty = PEOPLE.may_load(&store, "john")?;
    assert_eq!(None, empty);

    Ok(())
}
```

### Key types

A `Map` key can be anything that implements the `PrimaryKey` trait. There are a series of implementations of
`PrimaryKey` already provided (see `packages/storage-plus/src/keys.rs`):

 - `impl<'a> PrimaryKey<'a> for &'a [u8]`
 - `impl<'a> PrimaryKey<'a> for &'a str`
 - `impl<'a> PrimaryKey<'a> for Vec<u8>`
 - `impl<'a> PrimaryKey<'a> for String`
 - `impl<'a> PrimaryKey<'a> for Addr`
 - `impl<'a> PrimaryKey<'a> for &'a Addr`
 - `impl<'a, T: PrimaryKey<'a> + Prefixer<'a>, U: PrimaryKey<'a>> PrimaryKey<'a> for (T, U)`
 - `impl<'a, T: PrimaryKey<'a> + Prefixer<'a>, U: PrimaryKey<'a> + Prefixer<'a>, V: PrimaryKey<'a>> PrimaryKey<'a> for (T, U, V)`
 - `impl<'a, T: Endian + Clone> PrimaryKey<'a> for IntKey<T>`

That means that byte and string slices, byte vectors, and strings, can be conveniently used as keys.
Moreover, some other types can be used as well, like addresses and addresses references, pairs and triples, and
integer types.

If the key represents and address, we suggest using `&Addr` for keys in storage, instead of `String` or string slices. This implies doing address validation
through `addr_validate` on any address passed in via a message, to ensure it's a legitimate address, and not random text
which will fail later.

Thus, `pub fn addr_validate(&self, &str) -> Addr` in `deps.api` can be used for address validation, and the returned
`Addr` can be conveniently used as key in a `Map` or similar structure.

### Composite Keys

There are times when we want to use multiple items as a key, for example, when
storing allowances based on account owner and spender. We could try to manually
concatenate them before calling, but that can lead to overlap, and is a bit
low-level for us. Also, by explicitly separating the keys, we can easily provide
helpers to do range queries over a prefix, such as "show me all allowances for
one owner" (first part of the composite key). Just like you'd expect from your
favorite database.

Here how we use it with composite keys. Just define a tuple as a key and use that
everywhere you used a byte slice above.

```rust
// Note the tuple for primary key. We support one slice, or a 2 or 3-tuple
// adding longer tuples is quite easy but unlikely to be needed.
const ALLOWANCE: Map<(&str, &str), u64> = Map::new("allow");

fn demo() -> StdResult<()> {
    let mut store = MockStorage::new();

    // save and load on a composite key
    let empty = ALLOWANCE.may_load(&store, ("owner", "spender"))?;
    assert_eq!(None, empty);
    ALLOWANCE.save(&mut store, ("owner", "spender"), &777)?;
    let loaded = ALLOWANCE.load(&store, ("owner", "spender"))?;
    assert_eq!(777, loaded);

    // doesn't appear under other key (even if a concat would be the same)
    let different = ALLOWANCE.may_load(&store, ("owners", "pender")).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(None, different);

    // simple update
    ALLOWANCE.update(&mut store, ("owner", "spender"), |v| {
        Ok(v.unwrap_or_default() + 222)
    })?;
    let loaded = ALLOWANCE.load(&store, ("owner", "spender"))?;
    assert_eq!(999, loaded);

    Ok(())
}
```

### Path

Under the scenes, we create a `Path` from the `Map` when accessing a key.
`PEOPLE.load(&store, b"jack") == PEOPLE.key(b"jack").load()`.
`Map.key()` returns a `Path`, which has the same interface as `Item`,
reusing the calculated path to this key.

For simple keys, this is just a bit less typing and a bit less gas if you
use the same key for many calls. However, for composite keys, like
`(b"owner", b"spender")` it is **much** less typing. And highly recommended anywhere
you will use the a composite key even twice:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
struct Data {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}

const PEOPLE: Map<&str, Data> = Map::new("people");
const ALLOWANCE: Map<(&str, &str), u64> = Map::new("allow");

fn demo() -> StdResult<()> {
    let mut store = MockStorage::new();
    let data = Data {
        name: "John".to_string(),
        age: 32,
    };

    // create a Path one time to use below
    let john = PEOPLE.key("john");

    // Use this just like an Item above
    let empty = john.may_load(&store)?;
    assert_eq!(None, empty);
    john.save(&mut store, &data)?;
    let loaded = john.load(&store)?;
    assert_eq!(data, loaded);
    john.remove(&mut store);
    let empty = john.may_load(&store)?;
    assert_eq!(None, empty);

    // Same for composite keys, just use both parts in key().
    // Notice how much less verbose than the above example.
    let allow = ALLOWANCE.key(("owner", "spender"));
    allow.save(&mut store, &1234)?;
    let loaded = allow.load(&store)?;
    assert_eq!(1234, loaded);
    allow.update(&mut store, |x| Ok(x.unwrap_or_default() * 2))?;
    let loaded = allow.load(&store)?;
    assert_eq!(2468, loaded);

    Ok(())
}
```

### Prefix

In addition to getting one particular item out of a map, we can iterate over the map
(or a subset of the map). This let us answer questions like "show me all tokens",
and we provide some nice `Bound`s helpers to easily allow pagination or custom ranges.

The general format is to get a `Prefix` by calling `map.prefix(k)`, where `k` is exactly
one less item than the normal key (If `map.key()` took `(&[u8], &[u8])`, then `map.prefix()` takes `&[u8]`.
If `map.key()` took `&[u8]`, `map.prefix()` takes `()`). Once we have a prefix space, we can iterate
over all items with `range(store, min, max, order)`. It supports `Order::Ascending` or `Order::Descending`.
`min` is the lower bound and `max` is the higher bound.

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
pub enum Bound {
    Inclusive(Vec<u8>),
    Exclusive(Vec<u8>),
    None,
}
```

If the `min` and `max` bounds, it will return all items under this prefix. You can use `.take(n)` to
limit the results to `n` items and start doing pagination. You can also set the `min` bound to
eg. `Bound::Exclusive(last_value)` to start iterating over all items *after* the last value. Combined with
`take`, we easily have pagination support. You can also use `Bound::Inclusive(x)` when you want to include any
perfect matches. To better understand the API, please read the following example:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
struct Data {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: i32,
}

const PEOPLE: Map<&str, Data> = Map::new("people");
const ALLOWANCE: Map<(&str, &str), u64> = Map::new("allow");

fn demo() -> StdResult<()> {
    let mut store = MockStorage::new();

    // save and load on two keys
    let data = Data { name: "John".to_string(), age: 32 };
    PEOPLE.save(&mut store, "john", &data)?;
    let data2 = Data { name: "Jim".to_string(), age: 44 };
    PEOPLE.save(&mut store, "jim", &data2)?;

    // iterate over them all
    let all: StdResult<Vec<_>> = PEOPLE
        .range(&store, Bound::None, Bound::None, Order::Ascending)
        .collect();
    assert_eq!(
        all?,
        vec![("jim".to_vec(), data2), ("john".to_vec(), data.clone())]
    );

    // or just show what is after jim
    let all: StdResult<Vec<_>> = PEOPLE
        .range(
            &store,
            Bound::Exclusive("jim"),
            Bound::None,
            Order::Ascending,
        )
        .collect();
    assert_eq!(all?, vec![("john".to_vec(), data)]);

    // save and load on three keys, one under different owner
    ALLOWANCE.save(&mut store, ("owner", "spender"), &1000)?;
    ALLOWANCE.save(&mut store, ("owner", "spender2"), &3000)?;
    ALLOWANCE.save(&mut store, ("owner2", "spender"), &5000)?;

    // get all under one key
    let all: StdResult<Vec<_>> = ALLOWANCE
        .prefix("owner")
        .range(&store, Bound::None, Bound::None, Order::Ascending)
        .collect();
    assert_eq!(
        all?,
        vec![("spender".to_vec(), 1000), ("spender2".to_vec(), 3000)]
    );

    // Or ranges between two items (even reverse)
    let all: StdResult<Vec<_>> = ALLOWANCE
        .prefix("owner")
        .range(
            &store,
            Bound::Exclusive("spender1"),
            Bound::Inclusive("spender2"),
            Order::Descending,
        )
        .collect();
    assert_eq!(all?, vec![("spender2".to_vec(), 3000)]);

    Ok(())
}
```

## IndexedMap

In cw-plus, there's currently one example of `IndexedMap` usage, in the `cw721-base` contract.
Let's use it to illustrate `IndexedMap` definition and usage.

### Definition

```rust
pub struct TokenIndexes<'a> {
  // pk goes to second tuple element
  pub owner: MultiIndex<'a, (Addr, Vec<u8>), TokenInfo>,
}

impl<'a> IndexList<TokenInfo> for TokenIndexes<'a> {
  fn get_indexes(&'_ self) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = &'_ dyn Index<TokenInfo>> + '_> {
    let v: Vec<&dyn Index<TokenInfo>> = vec![&self.owner];
    Box::new(v.into_iter())
  }
}

pub fn tokens<'a>() -> IndexedMap<'a, &'a str, TokenInfo, TokenIndexes<'a>> {
  let indexes = TokenIndexes {
    owner: MultiIndex::new(
      |d: &TokenInfo, k: Vec<u8>| (d.owner.clone(), k),
      "tokens",
      "tokens__owner",
    ),
  };
  IndexedMap::new("tokens", indexes)
}
```

Let's discuss this piece by piece:
```rust
pub struct TokenIndexes<'a> {
  // pk goes to second tuple element
  pub owner: MultiIndex<'a, (Addr, Vec<u8>), TokenInfo>,
}
```

These are the index definitions. Here there's only one index, called `owner`. There could be more, as public
members of the `TokenIndexes` struct.

We see that the `owner` index is a `MultiIndex`. A multi-index can have repeated values as keys. That's why
the primary key is being added as the last element of the multi-index key.
Like the name implies, this is an index over tokens, by owner. Given that an owner can have multiple tokens,
we need a `MultiIndex` to be able to list / iterate over all the tokens a given owner has.

So, to recap, the `TokenInfo`  data will originally be stored by `token_id` (which is a string value).
You can see this in the token creation code:
```rust
    tokens().update(deps.storage, &msg.token_id, |old| match old {
        Some(_) => Err(ContractError::Claimed {}),
        None => Ok(token),
    })?;
```
(Incidentally, this is using `update` instead of `save`, to avoid overwriting an already existing token).

Then, it will be indexed by token `owner` (which is an `Addr`), so that we can list all the tokens an owner has.
That's why the `owner` index key is `(Addr, Vec<u8>)`. The first owned element is the `owner` data
, whereas the second one is the `token_id` (converted internally to `Vec<u8>`).

The important thing here is that the key (and its components, in the case of a combined key) must implement
the `PrimaryKey` trait. You can see that the 2-tuple `(_, _)`, `Addr`, and `Vec<u8>` do implement `PrimaryKey`:

```rust
impl<'a, T: PrimaryKey<'a> + Prefixer<'a>, U: PrimaryKey<'a>> PrimaryKey<'a> for (T, U) {
    type Prefix = T;
    type SubPrefix = ();

    fn key(&self) -> Vec<&[u8]> {
        let mut keys = self.0.key();
        keys.extend(&self.1.key());
        keys
    }
}
```

```rust
impl<'a> PrimaryKey<'a> for Addr {
    type Prefix = ();
    type SubPrefix = ();

    fn key(&self) -> Vec<&[u8]> {
        // this is simple, we don't add more prefixes
        vec![self.as_bytes()]
    }
}
```

```rust
impl<'a> PrimaryKey<'a> for Vec<u8> {
    type Prefix = ();
    type SubPrefix = ();

    fn key(&self) -> Vec<&[u8]> {
        vec![&self]
    }
}
```

---

We can now see how it all works, taking a look at the remaining code:

```rust
impl<'a> IndexList<TokenInfo> for TokenIndexes<'a> {
    fn get_indexes(&'_ self) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = &'_ dyn Index<TokenInfo>> + '_> {
        let v: Vec<&dyn Index<TokenInfo>> = vec![&self.owner];
        Box::new(v.into_iter())
    }
}
```

This implements the `IndexList` trait for `TokenIndexes`.
Note: this code is more or less boiler-plate, and needed for the internals. Do not try to customize this;
just return a list of all indexes.
Implementing this trait serves two purposes (which are really one, and the same): it allows the indexes
to be queried through `get_indexes`, and, it allows `TokenIndexes` to be treated as an `IndexList`. So that
it can be passed as a parameter during `IndexedMap` construction, below:

```rust
pub fn tokens<'a>() -> IndexedMap<'a, &'a str, TokenInfo, TokenIndexes<'a>> {
    let indexes = TokenIndexes {
        owner: MultiIndex::new(
            |d: &TokenInfo, k: Vec<u8>| (d.owner.clone(), k),
            "tokens",
            "tokens__owner",
        ),
    };
    IndexedMap::new("tokens", indexes)
}
```

Here `tokens()` is just a helper function, that simplifies the `IndexedMap` construction for us. First the
index (es) is (are) created, and then, the `IndexedMap` is created (using `IndexedMap::new`), and returned.

During index creation, we must supply an index function per index
```rust
        owner: MultiIndex::new(
            |d: &TokenInfo, k: Vec<u8>| (d.owner.clone(), k),
```

, which is the one that will take the value, and the primary key (which is always in `Vec<u8>` form) of the
original map, and create the index key from them. Of course, this requires that the elements required
for the index key are present in the value (which makes sense).
Besides the index function, we must also supply the namespace of the pk, and the one for the new index.

---

After that, we just create and return the `IndexedMap`:

```rust
    IndexedMap::new("tokens", indexes)
```

Here of course, the namespace of the pk must match the one used during index(es) creation. And, we pass our
`TokenIndexes` (as an `IndexList`-type parameter) as second argument. Connecting in this way the underlying `Map`
for the pk, with the defined indexes.

So, `IndexedMap` (and the other `Indexed*` types) is just a wrapper / extension around `Map`, that provides
a number of index functions and namespaces to create indexes over the original `Map` data. It also implements
calling these index functions during value storage / update / removal, so that you can forget about it,
and just use the indexed data.

### Usage

An example of use, where `owner` is a `String` value passed as a parameter, and `start_after` and `limit` optionally
define the pagination range:

Notice this uses `prefix()`, explained above in the `Map` section.

```rust
    let limit = limit.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_LIMIT).min(MAX_LIMIT) as usize;
    let start = start_after.map(Bound::exclusive);
    let owner_addr = deps.api.addr_validate(&owner)?;

    let res: Result<Vec<_>, _> = tokens()
        .idx
        .owner
        .prefix(owner_addr)
        .range(deps.storage, start, None, Order::Ascending)
        .take(limit)
        .collect();
    let tokens = res?;
```
Now `tokens` contains `(token_id, TokenInfo)` pairs for the given `owner`.
The pk values are `Vec<u8>`, as this is a limitation of the current implementation.

Another example that is similar, but returning only the `token_id`s, using the `keys()` method:
```rust
    let pks: Vec<_> = tokens()
        .idx
        .owner
        .prefix(owner_addr)
        .keys(
            deps.storage,
            start,
            None,
            Order::Ascending,
        )
        .take(limit)
        .collect();
```
Now `pks` contains `token_id` values (as `Vec<u8>`s) for the given `owner`.

### Index keys deserialization

To deserialize keys of indexes (using the `*_de` functions), there are currently some requirements / limitations:

- For `UniqueIndex`: The primary key (`PK`) type needs to be specified, in order to deserialize the primary key to it.
This generic type comes with a default of `()`, which means that no deserialization / data will be provided
for the primary key. This is for backwards compatibility with the current `UniqueIndex` impl. It can also come handy
in cases you don't need the primary key, and are interested only in the deserialized value.

- For `MultiIndex`: The last element of the index tuple must be specified with the type you want it to be deserialized.
That is, the last tuple element serves as a marker for the deserialization type (in the same way `PK` does it in
`UniqueIndex`).

- There are currently some inconsistencies in the values that are returned for the different index keys. `MultiIndex`
returns a tuple with the remaining part of the index key along with the primary key, whereas `UniqueIndex` returns only
the primary key. This will be changed in the future (See https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/issues/532) for consistency
and compatibility with the base `Map` type behaviour.
