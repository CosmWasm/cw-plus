# Security Policy

This repository is part of the **CosmWasm** stack.
Please see the [Advisories] for its security policy.

[Advisories]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/SECURITY.md

> [!WARNING]  
> The best effort has been made that the contracts here are secure, and we have moved the more
> experimental contracts into community repositories like [cw-nfts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) and
> [cw-tokens](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-tokens). That said, we have not done an audit on them (formal or informal)
> and you can use them at your own risk. We highly suggest doing your own audit on any contract you plan to deploy
> with significant token value, and please inform us if it detects any issues so we can upstream them.
> 
> Until v1.0 APIs are subject to change. The contracts APIs are pretty much stable, most work is currently
> in `storage-plus` and `multi-test`.
