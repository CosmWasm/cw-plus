Note: `cw721` and `cw721-base` have moved to the new [`cw-nfts` repo](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) and can be
followed there.

Note: most of the `cw20-*` contracts besides `cw20-base` have moved to the new
[`cw-tokens` repo](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-tokens) and can be followed there.

This is a collection of specification and contracts designed for use on real networks. They are designed not just as
examples, but to solve real-world use cases, and to provide a reusable basis to build many custom contracts.

If you don't know what CosmWasm is, please check out [our homepage](https://cosmwasm.com) and
[our documentation](https://docs.cosmwasm.com) to get more background. We are running
[public testnets](https://github.com/CosmWasm/testnets#running) you can use to test out any contracts.

**Warning** None of these contracts have been audited and no liability is assumed for the use of this code. They are
provided to turbo-start your projects.

## Specifications

The most reusable components are the various cwXYZ specifications under `packages`. Each one defines a standard
interface for different domains, e.g. [cw20](./packages/cw20/README.md) for fungible tokens,
[cw721](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md) for non-fungible tokens,
[cw1](./packages/cw1/README.md) for "proxy contracts", etc. The interface comes with a human description in the READMEs,
as well as Rust types that can be imported.

They contain no logic, but specify an interface. It shows what you need to implement to create a compatible contracts,
as well as what interface we guarantee to any consumer of such contracts. This is the real bonus of specifications, we
can create an escrow contract that can handle many different fungible tokens, as long as they all adhere to the cw20
specification.

If you have ideas for new specifications , please [raise an issue](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/issues) or
[create a pull request](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/pulls) on this repo.

## Contracts

We provide sample contracts that either implement or consume these specifications to both provide examples, and provide
a basis for code you can extend for more custom contacts, without worrying about reinventing the wheel each time. For
example [`cw20-base`](./contracts/cw20-base) is a basic implementation of a `cw20` compatible contract that can be
imported in any custom contract you want to build on it.

CW1 Proxy Contracts:

- [`cw1-whitelist`](./contracts/cw1-whitelist) a minimal implementation of `cw1` mainly designed for reference.
- [`cw1-subkeys`](./contracts/cw1-subkeys) a simple, but useful implementation, which lets us use a proxy contract to
  provide "allowances" for native tokens without modifying the `bank` module.

CW3 Multisig:

- [`cw3-fixed-multisig`](./contracts/cw3-fixed-multisig) a simple implementation of the
  [cw3 spec](./packages/cw3/README.md). It is a multisig with a fixed set of addresses, created upon initialization.
  Each address may have the same weight (K of N), or some may have extra voting power. This works much like the native
  Cosmos SDK multisig, except that rather than aggregating the signatures off chain and submitting the final result, we
  aggregate the approvals on-chain.
- [`cw3-flex-multisig`](./contracts/cw3-flex-multisig) builds on cw3-fixed-multisig, with a more powerful implementation
  of the cw3 spec. It's a multisig contract backed by a cw4 (group) contract, which independently maintains the voter
  set.

CW4 Group:

- [`cw4-group`](./contracts/cw4-group) a basic implementation of the [cw4 spec](./packages/cw4/README.md). It handles
  elected membership, by admin or multisig. It fulfills all elements of the spec, including raw query lookups, and is
  designed to be used as a backing storage for [cw3 compliant contracts](./packages/cw3/README.md).
- [`cw4-stake`](./contracts/cw4-stake) a second implementation of the [cw4 spec](./packages/cw4/README.md). It fulfills
  all elements of the spec, including raw query lookups, and is designed to be used as a backing storage for
  [cw3 compliant contracts](./packages/cw3/README.md). It provides a similar API to [`cw4-group`], but rather than
  appointing members, their membership and weight are based on the number of staked tokens they have.

CW20 Fungible Tokens:

- [`cw20-base`](./contracts/cw20-base) a straightforward, but complete implementation of the cw20 spec along with all
  extensions. Can be deployed as-is, or imported by other contracts.

## Compiling

To compile all the contracts, run the following in the repo root:

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.13.0
```

This will compile all packages in the `contracts` directory and output the stripped and optimized wasm code under the
`artifacts` directory as output, along with a `checksums.txt` file.

If you hit any issues there and want to debug, you can try to run the following in each contract dir:
`RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-s" cargo build --release --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --locked`

## Quality Control

One of the basic metrics of assurance over code quality is how much is covered by unit tests. There are several tools
available for Rust to do such analysis and we will describe one below. This should be used as a baseline metric to give
some confidence in the code.

Beyond code coverage metrics, just having a robust PR review process with a few more trained eyes looking for bugs is
very helpful in detecting paths the original coder was not aware of. This is more subjective, but looking at the
relevant PRs and depth of discussion can give an idea how much review was present.

After that, fuzzing it (ideally with an intelligent fuzzer that understands the domain) can be valuable. And beyond that
formal verification can provide even more assurance (but is very time-consuming and expensive).

### Code Coverage

I recommend the use of [tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin): `cargo install cargo-tarpaulin`

To get some nice interactive charts, you can go to the root directory and run:

`cargo tarpaulin -o html` and then `xdg-open tarpaulin-report.html` (or just `open` on MacOS).

Once you find a package that you want to improve, you can do the following to just analyze this package, which gives
much faster turn-around:

`cargo tarpaulin -o html --packages cw3-fixed-multisig`

Note that it will produce a code coverage report for the entire project, but only the coverage in that package is the
real value. If does give quick feedback for you if you unit test writing was successful.

See our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Generating changelog

To generate a changelog we decided to use
[github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator).

To install tool you need Ruby's `gem` package manager.

    $ gem --user install github_changelog_generator

And put `$HOME/.gem/ruby/*/bin/` into your PATH.

Generating changelog file first time:

    $ github_changelog_generator -u CosmWasm -p cw-plus

Appending next releases could be done adding `--base` flag:

    $ github_changelog_generator -u CosmWasm -p cw-plus --base CHANGELOG.md

If you hit GitHub's 50 requests/hour limit, please follow
[this](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator#github-token) guide to create a token
key which you can pass using `--token` flag.

There's also a convenience `scripts/update_changelog.sh`, which can take a --since-tag parameter (to avoid processing
the entire history). It can also auto-detect the latest version tag for you, with --latest-tag.
