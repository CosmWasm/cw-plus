/*!
Most of the CW* specs are focused on the *public interfaces*
of the contract. The APIs used for `ExecuteMsg` or `QueryMsg`.
However, when we wish to migrate or inspect smart contract info,
we need some form of smart contract information embedded on state.

This is where CW2 comes in. It specifies a special Item to
be stored on disk by all contracts on `instantiate`.

`ContractInfo` must be stored under the `"contract_info"` key which translates
to `"636F6E74726163745F696E666F"` in hex format.
Since the state is well defined, we do not need to support any "smart queries".
We do provide a helper to construct a "raw query" to read the ContractInfo
of any CW2-compliant contract.

For more information on this specification, please check out the
[README](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/cw2/README.md).
