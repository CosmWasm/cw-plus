/*!
CW3 is a specification for voting contracts based on CosmWasm.
It is an extension of CW1 (which served as an immediate 1 of N multisig).
In this case, no key can immediately execute, but only propose
a set of messages for execution. The proposal, subsequent
approvals, and signature aggregation all happen on chain.

For more information on this specification, please check out the
[README](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/cw3/README.md).
